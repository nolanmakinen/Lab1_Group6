# Lab1_Group6
Nolan Makinen & Princess Okerulu
## Purpose of Lab 1
The purpose of lab 1 was to collaboratively make a Python program that generates secure passwords based on user defined creteria (Length, number of letters, digits & special characters), As well as to validate user inputs.

## How the work was devided

| Nolan Makinen    | Steps 1, 2 & 5         |
| Princess Okerulu | Steps 3 & 4            |
## Provided code
We were provided this code as a base for the structure of the program.
```
import random
import string

# Function to get user input (skeleton)
def get_user_input(prompt, min_value, max_value):
    # Implement logic to get valid user input within a range
    pass

# Function to generate a password (skeleton)
def generate_password(length, num_letters, num_digits, num_specials):
    # Ensure total requested characters do not exceed length
    # Generate required characters (letters, digits, specials)
    # Fill remaining characters
    # Shuffle and return password
    pass

# Main function (skeleton)
def main():
    print("\n--- Secure Password Generator ---\n")

    # Step 1: Get user inputs for password length and character distribution

    # Step 2: Validate user inputs

    # Step 3: Generate the password

    # Step 4: Display the generated password

    # Step 5: Save password to file

# Entry point of the script
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
